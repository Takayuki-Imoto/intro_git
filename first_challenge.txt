to staging area => git add
to local repository => git commit
to remote repository => git push
to check contemporary status => git status

git log
down press[j]
up press[k]
exit press[q]

igt log --oneline

git log -p

to staging area which you removed file => git rm 
to local repository => git commit -v

you have to add or commit a single change, so git add is likely waiting room because of selecting a file among everal changed files.
